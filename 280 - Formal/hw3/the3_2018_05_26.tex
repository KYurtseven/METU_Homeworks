\section*{Answer 3}

Given transition rule $\delta(q,x) = (p,y,d)$ where $q$ is the current state, $x$ is the content of the current cell, $p$ is the new state, $y$ is the replacing symbol and $d$ is the direction, when we move only to the right, $d$ becomes irrelevant. Also, it is unnecessary to overwrite something because we always move to the right. Even if we write over something, that becomes useless. Therefore we can ignore $y$ and $d$. Hence, we will have $\delta(q,x) = (p)$, i.e. transition for Finite Automata.

A queue machine can be defined as a six-tuple:\\
$M = (Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\$, s, \delta)$ where,
\\
$Q$ is a finite set of states,\\
$\Sigma \subset \Gamma$ is the finite set of the input alphabet,\\
$\Gamma$ is the finite queue alphabet,\\
$\$ \in \Gamma - \Sigma $ is the initial queue symbol,\\
$s \in Q$ is the start state,\\
$\delta: Q$ x $T \rightarrow Q$ x $\Gamma^*$is the transition function.\\

Let me explain the notations above. Since I couldn't draw Turing Machine, I draw Finite Automaton and give each circle a number. Normally, there shouldn't be a number and a circle, but these are for clarifying my solutions. It is easy to draw finite automaton.Also, I didn't include the transition that corresponds to the "no" state. All transitions that are not listed above yields to "no" states. If I draw those transitions, my graph will be very complicated.\\
First, I assume that the given Turing Machine tape will be like in the following: $SUabbcccUU...$ where $S$ denotes start, $U$ denotes blank character, and rest are the string. \\
When we start at circle number one, we immediately move head to the right and start read the character under the head.\\
There are 2 options. If we read a $b$, we move to the circle 14 and move Right. And if read a blank character in here, that means we have reached the end of the input. We can accept this state. This string consists of only $b$.\\
Second option is we saw $a$. Then move in second circle. Whenever we see an $a$, we move head to the right. When we see a $b$, we move to the 3rd circle.\\
We replace this $b$ with $X$ and we do transition $L_u$ to find beginning of the string. When we reached the beginning of the string, we move right, under the head, there will be an $a$.\\
When we read an $a$, we move to the 4th circle, and we are replacing the current character, aka the $a$ with Y. In the 4th circle, whenever I see an $a$ or an $X$, I move to the right. I'm not replacing read symbols with $Y$. I'm only looping over the R symbol, which moves head to the right. Whenever I see a $b$, I move to the 5th circle.\\
In the 5th circle, when we are in the first iteration, we have 2 choice. The remaining characters are consist of $b$'s and $c$'s. Also, since we marked the first $b$ with an $X$, if the given string is correct, we should have $(2^n - 1)$ $b$'s in the string now. i.e. If I have 8 $b$ in the string at first, before I visit 5th circle, I must have 7 $b$'s. In the 5th circle, I change my $b$ to $X$, then if I see a $b$, I move to the 6th circle. In 6th circle, I skip $X$'s and when I see a $b$, I mark it as an $X$ and move to the 5th state.\\
One thing to mention here is that, when I do this loop in 2nd time, the square loop consists of 4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-4, I have some $X$'s and some $b$'s in my string. Therefore I need to do a transition between 5 and 6 to skip those $X$'s. Also, every time I run over this loop, I'm marking half of the $b$'s with $X$. Since I have marked first $b$ in the 3rd circle, I have guaranteed that $(2^n -1)$ $b$ will end in $n$ cycles.\\
In the 5th cycle, when I have finish $b$'s, I should have encounter with a $c$. So for every $a$, I should have change 3 $c$'s into $Z$'s and move right to read next $c$.\\
In the 10th circle, I have finished marking 3 $c$, so I should go to the beginning of the string.\\
In the 11th circle, I'm going right to find the first $a$. If I find an $a$, I mark that $a$ as a $Y$, and do the loop 4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-4. In this loop, for every $a$, I delete half of the $b$'s, and 3 $c$.\\
Again in the 11th circle, if I didn't encounter with an $a$ after I skipped $Y$'s, if the given string is correct, I expect that the character under the head must be a $X$, aka former $b$.\\
So, in circles 12 and 13, if the given string is correct, my string should be consist of as: YYXXXXZZZZZZ. I go right to find an blank character. When I find a blank character, it means that the given string is in the language, and the Turing Machine accepts that string.\\
The not drawn transitions always lead us to the not accepting state. For example, in the middle of conversion of my $b$'s to $X$'s, if I see an $a$, given string is not acceptable. It should go to the "no" state and halts. Also, while reading 3 consecutive $c$'s, I'm not expecting any character other than $c$.\\
In the 11th circle, if I don't encounter with an $a$, my string must be consist of $Y$'s, $X$'s and $Z$'s only. If any $a,b,c$ character  stayed in those states, that means the string is not in the language. While reading in 12 and 13, if I encounter with any of those characters, the machine must halt and reject the given string.\\

No, not always. Recursively enumerable languages (semi-decidable) are not closed under complement.\\
RE promises us an acceptor, not a decider. Therefore, if we flip the machine, we'll have a machine that says "no" for the word is not in the language but loop otherwise. That is not a RE.\\
Also, proof by contradiction:\\
1- If L and its complement are both semi-decidable, then both are decidable.\\
2- Hence, if RE is closed under complement, we'll have R=RE.\\
3- But, it must R $\subset$ RE (by halting problem, it is semi-decidable), so it is a contradiction.
